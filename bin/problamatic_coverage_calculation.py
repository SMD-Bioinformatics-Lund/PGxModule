This script reads a depths file (with columns: chr, position, depth),
a panel bed file (columns: chr, start, end, gene), and a problematic regions (overlap) bed file
(columns: chr, start, end, name). It generates an overlap report and plots the read depth
with overlapping problematic regions shaded. It also calculates per‐gene overlap metrics
and creates per‐gene plots.
